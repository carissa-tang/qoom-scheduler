## What does the project do?
Our project is an appointment scheduling web application on Qoom. We wanted an easy way for Qoom users to design personal meetings, office hours, or other events and invite guests to sign up at convenient times. The project can be divided into two parts: schedulers and attendees. 

> *Schedulers:*
> - Schedulers can create events and select details such as meeting name, location, description, and length. 
> - They then select their availability from a calendar, and input available hours. 
> - Once they have confirmed their choices, they will be able to view the event live and send it to potential attendees for them to fill out their availability. 

> *Attendees:*
> - Attendees can view meeting details and select their availability by choosing the most convenient start time for the event. 
> - They will be asked to enter their name and email for a confirmation, with no additional registration needed. 

## Why is this project useful?
- Convenient system to add availability for your next events/meetings and keep track of appointments made
- Hosted within their own server on Qoom, rather than an external calendar app such as Calendly or Strawpoll; no additional registrations required by the scheduler!
- Event link allows users to easily share upcoming events with potential guests
- By remixing this project, businesses can customize the scheduling app to fit their brand and business objectives; no external branding attached

## How can users get started with the project?
- Schedulers can use this Scheduler app to create an upcoming event
- Attendees can fill out basic information and choose availability
- Users can remix this project and customize the design of the scheduler
- Users can personalize this Scheduler to fit their own organizations and projects
