## 2. Intro & Goal

Our project is an appointment scheduling web application on Qoom. We wanted an easy way for Qoom users to design personal meetings, office hours, or other events and invite guests to sign up at convenient times. The project can be divided into two parts: schedulers and attendees.

## 2. Who is it for?

 All Qoom users are able to use this appointment scheduling app.
*Schedulers:*
> - Schedulers can create events and select details such as meeting name, location, description, and length. 
> - They then select their availability from a calendar, and input available hours. 
> - Once they have confirmed their choices, they will be able to view the event live and send it to potential attendees for them to fill out their availability. 

*Attendees:*
> - Attendees can view meeting details and select their availability by choosing the most convenient start time for the event. 
> - They will be asked to enter their name and email for a confirmation, with no additional registration needed. 

## 3. Why build it?

To facilitate the process of planning meetings between multiple parties.

## 4. What is it?

Appointment scheduling application, a convenient system to add availability for your next events/meetings and keep track of appointments made.
